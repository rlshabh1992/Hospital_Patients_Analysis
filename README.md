Hello! 👋

🚀 Unveiling Insights with Power BI! 🚀

I recently worked on an in-depth Hospital Patients Analysis using Power BI, and the insights were truly eye-opening! 📊

By analyzing the data, I was able to categorize and understand:
✅ Number of Day Cases – Patients who were treated and discharged on the same day.
✅ Inpatients – Those who stayed at the hospital for at least one night.
✅ Outpatients – Patients who visited for consultations or minor procedures without staying overnight.
✅ Average and Median Case Duration – Gained valuable insights into the typical length of hospital visits, helping in resource allocation and operational efficiency.

The visualizations provided a clear overview, enabling data-driven decision-making to improve patient care and optimize hospital management. 🏥💡

Power BI continues to be an incredible tool for turning complex data into actionable insights!
